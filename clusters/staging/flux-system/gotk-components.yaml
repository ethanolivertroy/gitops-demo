# Flux GitOps Toolkit Components
# This file is typically generated by `flux bootstrap` but we provide
# a reference version showing FedRAMP 20x aligned configurations.
#
# FedRAMP 20x KSI Alignment:
# - KSI-SVC-04: Automated configuration management via GitOps
# - KSI-AFR-09: Persistent validation through continuous reconciliation
# - KSI-CNA-02: Hardened controller configurations
#
# NOTE: Run `flux bootstrap` to generate the actual components for your cluster.
# This file serves as documentation of the expected configuration.
---
# The actual gotk-components.yaml is generated by flux bootstrap.
# It includes:
# - source-controller: Watches Git repositories and Helm charts
# - kustomize-controller: Reconciles Kustomizations
# - helm-controller: Reconciles HelmReleases
# - notification-controller: Handles alerts and events
#
# Security configurations applied:
# - All controllers run as non-root
# - Read-only root filesystems
# - Dropped capabilities
# - Resource limits enforced
# - Network policies applied
#
# To bootstrap Flux with security hardening:
#
# flux bootstrap github \
#   --owner=YOUR_ORG \
#   --repository=gitops-demo \
#   --branch=main \
#   --path=./clusters/staging \
#   --components-extra=image-reflector-controller,image-automation-controller
#
# After bootstrap, apply additional hardening via patches in this directory.
